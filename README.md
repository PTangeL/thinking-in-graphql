* How many currencies in the system?
* How many types do we have in the system?


## How to install

- `git clone git@github.com:leanjscom/thinking-in-graphql.git`
- `cd thinking-in-graphql`
- `yarn install` or `npm install`
- `yarn start` or `npm start`

## Exercise part 2

1. Fix the start script in package.json
2. In src/server.js add graphqlExpress using https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server#express.
3. The field currency in Course type (src/graphql/types/course) should be of type CurrencyTypeEnum and should be non null.
4. The course field in src/graphql/fields/course should have the id of the course as an argument
5. Include the Voucher queries into src/graphql/fields/index.js
6. Finish the implementation in the vouchers field in src/graphql/fields/voucher.js
7. Fix the resolver in the voucher field in src/graphql/fields/voucher.js
8. The voucher type (src/graphql/types/voucher.js) should have a field called course that should return the course of that voucher. You should be able to do this https://goo.gl/ffGsDo
9. The course type (src/graphql/types/course.js) should have a field called vouchers that should resolve to a relay connection with all the vouchers of that course. You should be able to do this https://goo.gl/PfRF4K
